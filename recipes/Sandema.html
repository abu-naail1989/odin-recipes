    <h1>Dawadawa Rice</h1>

    <p><strong>Dawadawa Rice</strong> is most prestigious and acclaimed the cultural dish of 
        Northern Ghana. Dawadawa powder is the ground product of fermented seeds of the African 
        Locust Bean tree. It is used in some West African dishes,
         and adds a very pungent taste to those dishes. Every section of the North has
        their own recipe for the dish, but one ingredient is common for all --
        dawadawa. It is one of the easiest dishes to serve and is
        cost-efficient.</p>
